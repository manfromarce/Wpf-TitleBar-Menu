## Custom title bar with menu in WPF

This demo app shows how to create a custom Visual Studio-inspired title bar in WPF.
It provides a sample main menu and allows you to add additional buttons, retaining all the Windows title bar features.
The only limitation is that the Windows 11 snap layouts panel isn't displayed when hovering over the Maximize button, but it works if you press Win+Z or drag the window to the screen border.

#### How to use:
- clone this repo or download the source code as ZIP
- tweak the code in MainWindow.xaml and App.xaml to suit your needs. By default, the sample title bar contains an additional Settings button near the minimize button, and displays the window icon and title. You can easily remove or change these elements, or change the title bar color.
